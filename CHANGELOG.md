# Changelog

Releases of the Elden Ring module. Versions before v0.3.0 were all-in-one downloads
released from the original repository (now Git-Gud-Gym/launcher).

## v0.3.0 - 2026-11-07

- Now a module for the Git Gud Gym hub, in its own repository: install it from the Library.
- Stats and the log move to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitGudGym\data\eldenring`.
- Same gameplay as v0.2.0.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-11-07

- **Finds the game by itself:** searches every Steam library, Steam's install record, and common folders
  on every drive.
- **Game location in the sidebar:** shows where the game is, with **Browse…** and **Auto-detect** buttons.
- **Launch game starts the game offline:** on Steam copies it offers to create `steam_appid.txt`, so the
  game starts without Easy Anti-Cheat.
- **Admin on start:** the app asks for administrator rights when it starts, so it can launch and attach
  to the game even when the game runs as admin.
- The left column no longer scrolls.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-11-07

First release. Tested on Elden Ring **1.12.0** (`eldenring.exe` 2.2.0.0).

### Training
- **Player can't die:** lethal hits refill your HP and count as a death.
- **Boss can't die:** the boss refills to full HP at zero and it counts as a defeat. Phase changes
  triggered by HP thresholds still happen.
- **Falling counts as death:** fall too far below the last solid ground you stood on and you're put
  back there. The distance is adjustable, 8 to 60 m.
- **Let boss die once:** for bosses whose phase change is a scripted death (Rennala, Radagon).
- **Automatic boss detection:** picks the biggest enemy within 80 m and switches between attempts.
  Next boss overrides the choice.

### Stats
- Per attempt: outcome, duration, damage dealt and taken, hits landed and taken, healing, and lowest
  boss HP %. Appended to `stats/attempts.csv`.
- Per session: totals, fastest defeat, average attempt, and best boss HP %. Appended to `stats/sessions.csv`.

### App
- Desktop app with live HP bars, session stats, an activity feed, and toggle switches. Settings are saved.
- Attaches automatically when the game is running, and unloads the mod when the app closes.
- Refuses to attach while Easy Anti-Cheat is running, and warns on untested game versions.
- In-game notifications when you die or beat the boss, plus a mini HUD (borderless or windowed mode).
- Notification sounds for deaths and boss defeats.
- In-game hotkeys F5 to F10.

### Known limitations
- A boss defeat refills HP but doesn't reset the boss to phase 1.
- Fall respawn, the notifications and the HUD are new and have had little in-game testing. Please
  report issues with your `gitgudgym.log`.
